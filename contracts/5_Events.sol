   Events? :
    Events give an abstraction on top of the EVMâ€™s logging functionality. 
    Applications can subscribe and listen to these events through the RPC interface of an Ethereum client.

    Indexed Parameters?:
    Events can have up to three indexed parameters, which makes it easier to search for specific events.
