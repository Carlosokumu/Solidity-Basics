   A contract can contain declarations of:
   1.State Variables -> State variables are variables whose values are permanently stored in contract storage.
   2.Functions  -> Functions are the executable units of code. Functions are usually defined inside a contract, but they can also be defined outside of contracts.
   3.Function Modifiers -> Function modifiers can be used to amend the semantics of functions in a declarative way.
   4.Events -> Events are convenience interfaces with the EVM logging facilities.
   5.Errors -> Errors allow you to define descriptive names and data for failure situations. Errors can be used in revert statements
   6.Struct Types -> Structs are custom defined types that can group several variables.
   7.Enum Types -> Enums can be used to create custom types with a finite set of â€˜constant values
